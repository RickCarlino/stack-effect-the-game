# Stack Effect: The Game

**Stack Effect: The Game** is a lighthearted game designed to enhance your understanding of Forth words and stack operations.

## About the Game

You'll encounter Forth-inspired stack operations and literals. Your goal is to guess the final state of the stack after a series of operations are applied. The game is simple to play and challenges your memory and intuition about stack-based programming.

### Key Features:

- Random Forth-like operations (e.g., `swap`, `dup`, `drop`, etc.) manipulate the stack.
- 6 operations per round
- Visual representation of the top of the stack to track progress.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Click the `Start Game` button to begin. A random stack operation or literal is applied every 2 seconds.
2. **Track the Stack:** Watch the top of the stack and think about how each operation affects it.
3. **Submit Your Guess:** After 6 turns, the game will stop, and you'll be prompted to guess the final state of the stack from top to bottom using emojis.
   - Example: If you think the final stack has `üçé` on top, followed by `üß∏`, type `üçéüß∏` into the guess box.
4. **Check Your Answer:** Submit your guess and find out if you're right!

## Stack Words and Operations

This game simulates a subset of Forth operations, including:

- **Emoji Keypad:** Quickly add literals to your guess by clicking the corresponding emoji.
- **Delete Button:** Remove the last emoji from your guess.
- **Turn Counter:** See how many turns have passed and how many remain.
- **Reset Button:** Restart the game at any time.
- **Literals:** `üíé`, `üåü`, `üçé`, etc. Push these onto the stack.
- **Stack Manipulation:**
  - `rot`: Rotate the top three items.
  - `-rot`: Reverse rotate the top three items.
  - `nip`: Remove the second item.
  - `tuck`: Copy the top item below the second item.
  - `drop`: Remove the top item.
  - `2drop`: Remove the top two items.
  - `dup`: Duplicate the top item.
  - `2dup`: Duplicate the top two items as a pair.
  - `over`: Copy the second item onto the top.
  - `2over`: Copy the second pair onto the top.
  - `2swap`: Swap the top two pairs.
  - `swap`: Exchange the top two items.

**Did I miss one?** Please raise an issue and I will add more words to the dictionary.

Each operation respects stack effect rules, ensuring consistency and predictability for those well-versed in Forth.

## Behind the Scenes

The stack is implemented as a simple JavaScript array, and each operation modifies it in place, simulating Forth's stack behavior. Legal moves are determined dynamically based on stack depth and operation constraints.

Enjoy the game, and may your stack always be in perfect order!
